Facial Verification System
Overview

The Facial Verification System is an advanced application designed to verify a person's identity by comparing facial features. Leveraging the power of Siamese neural networks, this project is focused on ensuring accurate, real-time verification using live video input from a webcam.
Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to implement a facial verification system that can:

    Capture live video input and extract relevant facial features.
    Use a pre-trained Siamese neural network model to compare and verify the captured facial image against a predefined template.
    Provide real-time feedback on whether the verification was successful or not.

Features

    Real-Time Verification: The system captures live video from a webcam and verifies the identity in real-time.
    Siamese Network Model: Utilizes a deep learning model designed to compare two images and determine their similarity.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface that allows for quick verification with minimal user interaction.

Technology Stack

    Python: The core programming language used for implementing the project.
    OpenCV: Used for video capture and image processing tasks.
    TensorFlow/Keras: Utilized for the implementation of the Siamese neural network.
    Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for development and testing.
    Usage

    Initialize the Webcam:
    Run the notebook to initialize the webcam. The system will start capturing live video.

    Capture Image for Verification:
    Press the 'V' key to capture the current frame for verification. The image will be saved and processed by the model.

    Perform Verification:
    The system will compare the captured image with the stored template and display the verification result on the screen.

    Exit the Application:
    Press the 'Q' key to quit the application.

Model Explanation
Siamese Neural Network

The core of this system is a Siamese neural network, which is particularly effective in tasks where the model needs to compare two inputs and determine their similarity. This model is trained to minimize the distance between embeddings of similar images and maximize the distance for dissimilar ones.
Verification Process

    Image Preprocessing: The captured image is preprocessed to match the input format expected by the model.
    Feature Extraction: The model extracts features from both the captured image and the template image.
    Comparison: The extracted features are compared, and a similarity score is generated.
    Decision: If the similarity score exceeds a predefined threshold, the images are considered a match.
